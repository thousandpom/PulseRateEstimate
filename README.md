# Motion Compensated Pulse Rate Estimation
*This is part of the Udaciy AI for Healthcare Nanodegree course projects.*

### Key Words:
`wearable_data`, `time_series_analysis`, `PPG`, `IMU`, `Fast_Fourier_Transform`, `Spectral_Density`

The repository contains two parts:
- `pulse_rate_estimate_algorithm` consists of a jupyter notebook to estimate pulse rates using wrist-type photoplethysmogram (PPG) and three-axis accelerometer signals (Troika Dataset). 
-  `clinical_application` contains the jupyter notebook used for analyzing a heart rate dataset from the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST).
