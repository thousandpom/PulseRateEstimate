The repository contains two parts:
- `pulse_rate_estimate_algorithm.ipynb` consists of a jupyter notebook to estimate pulse rates using wrist-type photoplethysmogram (PPG) and three-axis accelerometer signals (Troika Dataset). The goal of this part is to develop an algorithm to predict pulse rates using PPG and the 3-axis accelerometer component of Inertia Motion Units (IMUs) signals.
-  `clinical_application.ipynb` contains the jupyter notebook used for analyzing a heart rate dataset from the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST). In this part, I performed an analysis of the CAST dataset to better understand the similarity and the difference between female and male groups for their resting heart rate trend. 

 Before running the notebook, you should download the dataset following their corresponding path as noted in the notebook.
